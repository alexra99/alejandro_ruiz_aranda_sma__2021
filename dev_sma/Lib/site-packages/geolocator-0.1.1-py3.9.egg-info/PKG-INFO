Description: The geolocator library provides a common interface to location-related data
        from various sources and provides means to calculate distances between places.
        Currently the MaxMind country & city geoip data sources are supported. There is
        also some preliminary support for using GNS (GEOnet Names Server )data. For
        distance calculation, the Haversine function is used.
        
        The library can be useful for example to implement location-based features in
        different www frameworks; for an example of that, see the GeoLocation Zope /
        CMF / Plone package from which this library was spun off. Please note, however,
        that there is nothing www-specific in the library, nor does it have any
        external dependencies.
